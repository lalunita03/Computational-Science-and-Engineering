# Computational-Science-and-Engineering
Hands-on experience with commonly-used computational methods in science and engineering. Topics covered include computational simulation by discretization in space and time, numerical solution of linear and nonlinear equations, optimization, uncertainty quantification, and function approximation via interpolation and regression. Emphasis is on understanding trade-offs between computational effort and accuracy, and on developing working knowledge of how these tools can be used to solve a wide range of problems arising in applied math, science, and engineering.
